# Laws-for-AGI
This rule book is inspired by Elon Musk and his mission to create a regulatory body. This repo is intented to list all "rules" in a simplified manner such that the AI restricts itself. A key point is to have the AI be trained on these rules.


# Do's and Dont's:
Dont frame rules in a way that can be easily manipulated. 
### For example:
I will protect humans.
I will not play a role in humanity's destruction.
### Can be manipulated into:
I will not protect humans.
I will play a role in humanity's destruction.
